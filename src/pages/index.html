            <p>My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of
                Morioh, where all
                the
                villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get
                home
                every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make
                sure
                I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty
                minutes
                of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I
                wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last
                check-up.
                I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble
                myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is
                how I
                deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't
                lose
                to anyone.</p>
